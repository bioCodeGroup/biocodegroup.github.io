## BioCodeGroup Website Repository

The group website is a place for members to build a portfolio of personal, group, and graduate research projects to share with anyone that may be interested. Sharing a repository of code is one important aspect of a project, but it is also important to be able to discuss the project with those not familiar with the methods or biology. Thus this website is for group members wanting to share their work and interests with others without having to build their own personal website.

The website could potentially include the following from group members:

1. Personal projects containing descriptions of the code and science behind it
2. Group projects that are meant for practice and teaching
3. Research projects that are related to your graduate thesis
4. Blog posts on recent news, research that is relevant to bioinformatics or computational biology
5. Tutorials on bioinformatic tools, coding, biology that may be of interest to other students at CSU
6. Personal pages with descriptions of your interests and links to projects and other sites
7. Anything else that may be useful for you or other students

If you would like to add your page(s), please fork the repository, make your changes in a new branch with your name and page description, `name-page-name`, such as `kristen-bio-page` or `kristen-utility-scripts`, then make a pull request. 

Message the slack channel if you have questions or open an issue here if you are having problems.

This website uses the Jekyll theme 'Feeling Responsive', cloned from this repository: https://github.com/Phlow/feeling-responsive
