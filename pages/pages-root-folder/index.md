    	<li><h2>What is Bio Code Group?</h2></li>
		<li> BCG is an informal community at Colorado State University committed to advancing 
		programming, bioinformatics, and computational biology skills through hands-on practice
		and collaboration. We are mainly biologists, by training, that recognize the how valuable
		learning to code can be for biological research with the ever increasing amount of data
		we produce. Even if you want to spend the majority of your time as a biologist at the bench,
		learning these skills can help you accelerate and understand your work better. We welcome
		everyone that is interested in advancing programming, data science, or bioinformatics skills
		to join us. <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/info/"> More info ›</a></li>

    	<li><h3>Meetings & Events</h3></li>
		<li> Our main goal is to connect you with other biologists working on coding projects or
		interested in advancing their skillset in computational biology. We communicate about
		projects on Slack and GitHub, but also meet weekly to work on code. We hope to create an 
		encouraging environment for learning as well as make sure students dedicate at least a 
		couple hours per week to practice. Students can code or come here for guidance.

		<li><h4> Lunch and Code </h4></li>
		<li><b>Mondays, 12-2pm, BIO 428</b></li>
		<li>We host weekly meetups for everyone to just sit down and work on coding. Bring your lunch and a
		project to work on! </li>
