<b> A bit more background </b><br>
Write a more thorough background on yourself here. Cover your experience (work history, research, what 
you learned, coursework, fellowships, volunteering, etc). Describe your professional background and aspirations here. You want to make sure you cover the 
important stuff and what you love about STEM without going into excessive detail. Look at other 
personal pages for inspiration.

<br>
<b> My career interests </b><br>
Add your future/long-term career interests here (job type/title, environment, project topics, skills to learn, long-term career goals). 

<br>
<b> My MS/PhD work </b><br>
Add your dissertation project here. A brief description of what you study and why it is interesting. 

<br>
<b> My research interests </b><br>
Add your broader research interests here. Can be a culmination of all your experience and where you think it is taking you next.

<br>
<b> My current BCG work</b><br>
What is the project you are working on now? Do you want to just learn and practice? Something more specific? Describe it briefly here!
Highlight your favorite project if you have one!
<br>
<br>

<b> My projects & contributions </b><br>
Below, add projects you contribute to or are doing yourself as a part of BCG. This can
also include personal projects that are part of your learning & practicing journey! Link
to research or official projects as well if desired, or simply to your public repositories
online! Substitute images for representative ones and upload to the 'images' folder. Link to the page
on BCG and if it doesn't exist - create it! This is a platform for you to communicate your work
to the world, not just share your repositories. Below are just place holders, use the same formatting.
