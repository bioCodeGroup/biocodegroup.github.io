subheadline: "Why create a code group?"
teaser: "Many graduate students in biology want to learn programming and to be able to confidently use it or add it to their resume. However, learning often stops at the introductory coursework or there is a mismatch in expectations during the course. BCG hopes to provide an encouraging environment to just sit down and code with other students."

We started this group as a small way to encourage each other to practice coding at beginner and more advanced levels by providing opportunities for participation in educational projects and teaching. 
We currently focus on practical Python programming for scientists (automation of tasks, data analytics, visualization) over bioinformatic algorithms (such as those found on Rosalind). However, you can join us to code anything in any language. 


##Who should join?
Anyone interested in practicing programming or computational biology skills. Much like any skill, these require practice to master. 
All skill levels are welcome. Even if you struggled with the coursework, if you continue to practice you will get better. If you're more advanced in your
coding skills and are looking for more ways to practice and help others, we'd love to have you as well. Teaching is a great way to solidify understanding of a subject.
Additionally, you may find interesting projects to contribute to by meeting with other students. 

It is also intended for students interested in internships and careers involving computational work at all levels. 

##Why create a coding group?
From discussions with students and instructors, many of the people that leave the intro courses:

1) Never code during grad school because they don't have a need to
2) Didn't learn from a course due to a mismatch in expectations - it is too basic or too advanced
3) Experienced too much "hand-holding" - once out on their own for a real project, they become lost and frustrated

By getting together to just practice coding you can work in an environment that will provide practice more suited to your own background and pace.
By meeting with and getting to know other people learning to code or interested in mentoring 

##What will we do?
Meetings are intended to provide a community space to practice coding. We simply want to provide an encouraging environment for you to reach your goals. A place to ask questions and work on projects that either interest you or allow you to have structured practice.

We will teach git and project development on GitHub as we also want to provide a platform for you to showcase projects as well as gain an in-demand skill (version control) for computational positions in industry. Well-documented projects are great to have for your resume and technical interviews, even if they are simple.
The goal of the group (and publishing to a website like this) is to help students build a portfolio of projects throughout their graduate career that they can eventually discuss on interviews. Educational projects can spin off into more interesting side/research projects, but both can be valuable in the job search.
This is a very hands-on group. Guidance comes in the form of answering questions, providing resources, and assigning tasks. 

During meetings you may work on various projects:
1) Bring a personal or research project that you already have in mind or are working on
2) We can provide a beginner or intermediate practice group project on task automation
3) We can help guide and design a data analysis project

You can just sit down and code without talking to anyone. You can ask specific questions. You can work on a practice project with other students wanting to learn. 

##What will we not do?
We will not have lectures on programming, so it is expected that you have at least a basic foundation from the coursework or are able to self-teach and come to us for feedback. If you need a refresher we'll start you off with a beginner educational project to review.

We will not go into theory and algorithms that require more mathematical intuition, but you are welcome to work on these types of problems while you are there. 

If you want more lectures, consider joining the Bioinformatics club meetings as well. 

##What can I expect to get out of this?
If you want a technical career that involves coding or bioinformatics, there is very high chance you'll go through a technical interview of some kind. Simply taking a beginner course at the level we have here will not be enough to prepare you. We can practice technical interview questions and with projects on GitHub, you'll be knowledgeable enough to talk about them during interviews.

We also provide resources for self-learning, links to workshops or tutorials to attend, notice of networking opportunities and career guidance. This group is very focused on making sure you find and succeed in a target career.

Please let me know if this sounds like something that interests you and I will invite you to the GitHub organization and to the slack channel.
